About the Developer Track sessions
----------------

The goal of the Developer Track sessions is to provide developers with exposure to the draft OGC standards, as well as to share productivity advice about implementing the standards.

About the next Developer Track session

**When: Wednesday 16 June 2021 from 10:00 EDT to 18:00 EDT**

Register at https://portal.ogc.org/meet

The focus of the next Developer Track session will be on [GeoPose](https://www.ogc.org/projects/groups/geoposeswg), and OGC APIs for [Coverages](https://github.com/opengeospatial/ogcapi-coverages), [Routes](https://github.com/opengeospatial/ogcapi-routes), [Discrete Global Grid Systems (DGGS)](https://github.com/opengeospatial/ogcapi-discrete-global-grid-systems). Each practical work block will include a training, followed by prototype development.

Participants (including any member of the audience) will be invited to present a demonstration of their prototype during the Demonstrations session. All participants will be able to vote for their favourite demonstration.
